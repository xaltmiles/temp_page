        Teaching and learning in a competence-based curriculum: the case of
        four secondary schools in England

        This article focuses on four case study schools that have adopted
        innovative competence-based curriculum (CBC) projects in Year 7 for
        a variety of educational and social reasons. The article discusses the
        issues and challenges posed by the CBC for teachers in the daily life of
        the classroom. Philosophical ideas about the purpose of education
        vary because they are driven by ideological positions. Consequently
        the nature and structure of the curriculum inﬂuenced by the stance
        adopted inevitably aﬀects approaches to teaching and learning. It is
        contended that changes to the curricula in the case study schools have
        revealed tensions between traditional approaches to teaching and
        learning with ‘strong’ classiﬁcation and framing and the new, more
        progressive approaches with ‘weak’ classiﬁcation and framing. These
        tensions impact on teachers’ identities and this can make eﬀective
        classroom practice problematic. The article concludes that managing
        the tensions between traditional and more progressive pedagogies is
        worthwhile as this will enable students to become more fully inte-
        grated, and successful participatory members of twenty-ﬁrst-century
        society rather than simply reproducing the socio-economic status quo,
        or the requirements of current dominant educational discourse in
        England.

        Introduction
        This article focuses on teaching and learning as one of the aspects of
        education that were identiﬁed as particular challenges associated with the
        implementation and development of a competence-based curriculum
        (CBC) in a study of four secondary schools in England, discussed in the
        introductory article in this issue. The article builds on the overarching
        rationale and theoretical framework discussed in our introductory article
        and addresses speciﬁc issues raised there with regard to teaching and
        learning by answering a research question focused on developing our

        understanding of the challenges and constraints involved in teaching and
        learning in a CBC, which was derived from exploratory interviews with
        curriculum leaders conducted during an early stage of the project: ‘. . . we
        have a new pathological position at work in education: the pedagogic
        schizoid position’ (Bernstein 1999a, 252).
        
        Bernstein’s words are highly apposite with regard to the current
        educational landscape in England today. Teachers are, on the one hand,
        faced with increasing pressures to ensure that their pupils have the skills
        and abilities to meet the challenges of living, working and making a
        contribution to society now and in the future and, on the other, providing
        them with academic qualiﬁcations that rely upon a traditional curriculum
        and pedagogy. Teachers are, therefore, caught between a philosophical
        approach to education that embraces the need for sound disciplinary
        knowledge secured via traditional pedagogies and one that requires them
        to adopt a more outward-looking stance to enable their pupils to cope
        with market forces, change and an increasingly uncertain future (Giddens
        1990). This is nothing new, as Dewey remarks: ‘the history of educational
        theory is marked by opposition between the idea that education is
        development from within and that it is formation from without’ (Dewey
        1951, 1). The arguments about these tensions have already been rehearsed,
        for example between child-centred or progressive and traditional pedagogies
        (Holt 1964; Noddings 2005; Plowden 1967); competence-based or content-
        based curricula (Claxton 2008); democratic or emancipatory and con-
        servative or authoritarian educational ideologies (Dewey 1916; Freire 1972).
        Teachers are increasingly required to juggle these diametrically opposing
        positions (Bernstein 1999a). This can lead to tensions that may be diﬃcult to
        resolve, especially when espousing pedagogies that move away from more
        traditional approaches to teaching and learning towards those that are more
        synergistic with the new and innovative CBC projects undertaken by the
        four case study schools described in this article. As Hala´ sz and Michel (2011,
        1)   indicate, ‘the practical implementation which should make thousands
        of teachers change their professional behaviour’ is not an easy task but it is
        necessary if the implementation of CBCs is to be successful. Dabrowski and
        Wis´ niewski (2011) report in Poland that despite central government
        initiatives to develop some elements of key competencies, the necessary
        support to embed these approaches as part of school learning has not been
        provided and as a result competencies are not regarded as core business for
        schools. While in Spain key competencies have been incorporated into the
        curriculum for primary and lower secondary students, there is still a need for
        teachers to work together in a coordinated and cooperative manner to
        ensure that students are equipped with these competencies to be successful in
        their adult life (Tiana, Moya, and Luengo 2011). It seems that there are
        several obstacles for teachers to overcome when they engage in competence-
        based lessons. This may be even more acutely felt in England, where there is

        no central government support for a CBC. Therefore, in this article we focus
        on the teaching and learning challenges faced in the four case study schools
        described in the introductory article in this issue by addressing the question:
        What are the issues and tensions for teachers in classrooms that have lessons
        focussed on competencies rather than subject content?
        
        Theoretical framework and related literature
        According to Durkheim (1976), society is the creator of knowledge; i.e. it
        is a social reality. In his analysis of religious life in primitive societies
        Durkheim identiﬁed two types of knowledge – everyday knowledge that is
        based upon experience and observations, which he referred to as the
        ‘profane’; and the ‘sacred’ or religious knowledge which consists of sys-
        tems of abstract and collective concepts. While these two forms of
        knowledge are mutually exclusive one is not regarded as necessarily
        superior to the other. Both these forms of knowledge are necessary for a
        functioning society; on the one hand profane knowledge enables things to
        be done such as having someone mend your car, and on the other hand
        sacred knowledge is concerned with abstract concepts that enable people
        to make connections between ideas. Profane knowledge is, therefore,
        segmented, discrete and context-speciﬁc, whereas sacred knowledge
        enables generalisations and hypotheses to be made that result in theory
        generation. These forms of knowledge have diﬀerent purposes; one
        cannot be reduced to another but they are complementary to one another.
        In adopting a Durkheimian perspective on education, Bernstein (1999b)
        provides us with a useful framework to consider traditional subject-based
        and competence-based approaches to teaching and learning. In his analysis
        the sacred and profane are reconceptualised as vertical and horizontal
        knowledge structures or discourses. Horizontal discourses are context-
        dependent and segmented, whereas vertical discourses are general, explicit
        and coherent bodies of knowledge, such as traditional academic disciplines.
        Horizontal knowledge is gathered through activity and experience, and the
        knowledge gained is speciﬁc, whereas vertical knowledge is acquired through
        explanation and generalisation, and the knowledge is transferable. In the
        context of the four case study schools we can consider that the subject-based
        approach to teaching and learning might be regarded as a vertical discourse,
        or sacred knowledge, while competence-based approaches that rely upon
        more everyday thinking and experiences are horizontal, or profane.
        Diﬀerences in the pedagogic approaches required in order to develop these
        two knowledge structures, and the potential tensions that might arise within
        a CBC are of interest here.
        
        Bernstein’s dichotomy of horizontal and vertical discourse has its
        roots in his analysis of the curriculum and pedagogies that he describes
        respectively as strongly or weakly classiﬁed or framed (Bernstein 1973).
        
        
        354
        
        J. Byrne et al.
        
        A strongly classiﬁed curriculum is based upon the separation of academic
        subject disciplines and is often associated with strong framing that
        gives teachers control over what occurs in the classroom. In contrast,
        competence-based approaches to teaching and learning are characterised
        by weakly classiﬁed curricula often with weak pedagogical framing that
        oﬀer greater scope and autonomy in what and how subject matter is
        taught and learned (Bernstein 1999b). That said, most secondary class-
        rooms are organised with strong classiﬁcation and framing, where subject
        disciplines and teacher control are the norm (Bernstein 1990). This is
        endorsed by the highly prescribed curriculum in English schools that is
        ﬁrstly structured as a bounded body of educational knowledge and
        secondly internally diﬀerentiated into traditional subject content areas
        (Bernstein 1973). And this approach to curriculum development is
        likely to be further strengthened by current UK education policy, with its
        emphasis on traditional teaching that focuses on the teaching of subject
        disciplines (Department for Education 2010).
        
        Therefore, teachers and students may experience a clash of cultures
        between these opposing subject, didactic and pedagogic positions during
        diﬀerent parts of their school day that can aﬀect their identity (Ketelaar
        et al. 2012). Thus, consideration of how teachers operate and cooperate
        with their students in the classroom is an essential aspect of this approach
        to teaching and learning that we wish to explore.
        
        Secondary-school teachers’ identity is often framed by the subjects
        they teach (Hameyer 2007; Busher and Harris 1999; Helms 1998;
        Woolhouse and Cochrane 2010) and is thought to be discursively
        constructed through the use of particular subject repertoires (Trent 2010).
        Varghese et al. (2005) describe such identity formation as ‘identity-in-
        discourse’ where identity is created through interactions and conversa-
        tions in a professional context in which participants co-produce a narra-
        tive that re-inforces that identity (Davies and Harre 1999; Sfard and
        Prusak 2005). Therefore, the powerful vertical discourse of subject disci-
        plines can aﬀect how these identities are developed and hence teachers’
        approach to classroom practice and attitudes towards innovation (Beijaard
        et al. 2004). In adopting a competence-based approach to teaching and
        learning teachers may feel disconnected from their established subject-
        dependent identity. Having to abandon or adjust this identity may cause
        teachers to feel anxious or inadequate as they wrestle with an ‘actual’ and
        ‘ought’ self (Beauchamp and Thomas 2009). This may cause them to lack
        conﬁdence as a ‘non-specialist’ out of their comfort zone as others have
        shown; for example in teaching music (Seddon and Biasutti 2008), science
        (Tosun 2000), physical education (Morgan and Bourke 2008), or in parti-
        cular domains of a subject such as science content (Kind 2009) or scientiﬁc
        enquiry (Nivalainen et al. 2010). The resulting lack of agency as autonomous
        individuals who are competent to make independent decisions may make
        
        
        The Curriculum Journal 355
        
        teachers call into question their established teacher identity (Ketelaar et al.
        2012). As a result they may become less eﬃcacious practitioners, especially
        with regard to their willingness to cope with educational change and
        implement innovative teaching practices (Beijaard, Verloop, and Vermunt
        2000). Therefore, rather than engaging with the horizontal discourse
        required in competence-based lessons they may steer their teaching towards
        subject-speciﬁc material (Whitty et al. 1994).
        
        However, CBCs aim to enable students to ‘learn to learn’ and provide
        them with self-regulated learning skills and greater autonomy over their
        learning (Wesselink et al. 2010). Competence acquisition is considered to
        address social and educational requirements such as employability (Velde
        1999), civic competence (Gee 1999; Rychen and Salganik 2003) and
        academic success (Hoskins and Crick 2010). Furthermore, personal
        competencies and qualities such as optimism, resilience and empower-
        ment are regarded as important factors in being able to deal eﬀectively
        with uncertainty, change and complex decision-making, all of which
        school students are likely to face increasingly in their future lives (Claxton
        2008; Dyke 2006; Giddens 1990). Whitty (2010) cites White (2005), who
        argues that teaching and learning that focuses on competence develop-
        ment is regarded as necessary for all learners in the twenty-ﬁrst century.
        And as Yates and Collins (2010) indicate, advocates of competence-based
        learning stress the focus on students’ personal knowledge that oﬀers those
        from disadvantaged backgrounds more eﬀective access to learning. Thus,
        such approaches can be regarded as more egalitarian and enabling
        compared with traditional approaches to education that favour middle-
        class students (Bernstein 1973). Therefore, in adopting a competence-
        based approach to teaching and learning the continuous cycle of
        educational disenfranchisement of students from socially disadvantaged
        backgrounds may be broken (Freire 1972). Moreover, as Gibbons et al.
        (1994) and Wesselink et al. (2010) indicate, competence-based approaches
        to teaching and learning are thought to oﬀer students opportunities to
        experience learning in a practical manner and actively reﬂect on their
        learning, within a socially situated context, in order to develop their
        knowledge, skills and understanding; learning, therefore, becomes a more
        personally and socially active process. The role of the teacher in these
        competence-based lessons is thus one of
        facilitator or coach, or
        ‘pedagogical expert’ rather than a transmitter of knowledge (Beijaard,
        Verloop, and Vermunt 2000, 751). However, in the more student-centred,
        ﬂexible environment of competence-based lessons teachers have less con-
        trol over the learning process and they may have diﬃculty in reconciling
        the teaching and learning approaches that are synergistic with these aims
        and their perceived role (Ketelaar et al. 2012). If teachers are unable to
        make sense of the duality of these roles they may act to reinforce or
        protect their established identity (Ketelaar et al. 2012).
        
        
        356
        
        J. Byrne et al.
        
        However, critics of CBCs suggest that they may lead to superﬁcial
        learning of content (Hirsch 1987) or that they may become reductionist
        and prescriptive (Betts and Smith 1998) and, therefore, may result in
        utilitarian rather than liberating outcomes. More recently, Young (2011,
        275) notes that in establishing a curriculum in which ‘powerful knowl-
        edge’ has low status we must be careful not to throw the baby out with the
        bath water by removing the opportunity for students, especially those
        from disadvantaged backgrounds, to learn traditional subject disciplines.
        One possibility is to adopt a stance to classroom practice that embraces
        Young’s (2008) social realist approach to knowledge epistemology in
        which powerful knowledge is aligned with everyday knowledge as sets of
        systematically related concepts and methods historically located within
        distinctive and specialised communities of enquirers (Young 2011).
        
        The study
        The aim of this article is to ascertain how teachers in the case study schools,
        described in the introductory article, are meeting the pedagogical challenges
        resulting from their new curricula. This article reports only on data collected
        in relation to the focus on how the new curriculum has inﬂuenced aspects of
        teaching and learning. Data were collected from classroom observations,
        interviews, focus groups, student surveys and lesson plans. However, data
        presented here have an emphasis on lesson observations and interviews.
        Details of the data collection methods employed and their analysis can be
        found in the introductory article, also in this issue.
        
        Findings: day-to-day life in classrooms in the case study schools
        These ﬁndings form an amalgamation of the issues raised in all four case-
        study schools rather than a detailed comparative analysis of the diﬀerent
        schools, and examples illustrate the overall ﬁndings. However, reference
        to speciﬁc schools is oﬀered at times and some comparisons are made
        where ﬁndings are relevant to particular school contexts.
        
        Issue 1: overview of teaching and learning aims
        The intended multi-disciplinary and competence-based approach was
        evident in the planned topics in all schools. In the majority of lessons
        observed these skills were reﬂected in lesson aims and objectives, as this
        teacher indicates when discussing the intention of the programme:
        
        It’s about skills and just teaching them skills that they’re going to be able to
        use throughout the school rather than just, you know, being able to piece
        two pieces of evidence together to tell a story about something that
        happened 100 years ago. (Teacher, School 2)
        
        
        The Curriculum Journal 357
        
        However, these aims seem to be harder to achieve in the day-to-day reality
        of the classroom, as lesson observations indicate. Even though lesson aims
        and objectives were ﬁrmly focused on the key skills and competencies,
        explicitly articulated by the teacher and often left as a visual reminder for
        the students in written form (for example on the whiteboard), and in some
        lessons verbal reminders of the intended learning were also provided,
        teachers did not explore the meaning of the intended learning in such a
        way that secured students’ understanding or how to achieve the expected
        skills and competencies. Teachers appeared to expect students to develop
        skills and competencies instinctively as a result of oﬀering them
        opportunities to practise skills but in many lessons students seemed to
        be unsure about the skill base of the lesson and focussed on the subject
        content, as this student’s perception of lessons reﬂects: ‘We do like RE
        [Religious Education], Geography and History. And our group has mainly
        done like History and things, but we’ve also done a lot on RE, but we
        haven’t done that much on Geography yet’ (Student, School 4).
        
        This is regarded as a lack of student awareness about the key purpose of
        
        the lesson rather than a lack of speciﬁc teaching, as this teacher suggests:
        
        I would have to say that for the students they have been so used to doing a
        topic, a subject, learning something, information, that to them that’s their
        focus when they’re doing something. . . . I think the students don’t see skills
        as a focus, they see the actual ‘what am I doing?’ . . . They do still latch on
        to a topic, because I think that’s what they’ve been trained to do . . . this
        idea of ‘I’m gaining knowledge’. But I think you have got to focus on the
        skills, you absolutely have to focus on those skills and just do it through
        really interesting topics. (Teacher, School 3)
        
        However, particularly in Schools 1 and 2, some observations did indicate
        students were deploying skills such as Internet research, time manage-
        ment, group work and practical skills that promoted competency
        development. It is interesting to note that the competence-based approach
        is more established in these schools and, therefore, teachers may have
        reﬁned their lessons to allow for greater skill development. That said there
        was a clear mismatch between the stated aims of the lesson and what
        teachers did in class in the majority of the lessons we observed. The lack
        of explicit explanation about how to achieve particular skills seems to be a
        result of teachers’ inexperience and unfamiliarity in dealing with tacit
        knowledge acquisition. Procedural knowledge gain is assumed to be a
        practical hands-on activity that can only be fully acquired through
        practice but without further instruction such as breaking down the skill
        into discrete steps, an inherent aspect of an apprenticeship model of
        education, students (and teachers) resort to the subject content of lessons,
        as this teacher says: ‘And I’m not brilliant at it anyway; I do forget
        sometimes that I’m trying to deliver the skill rather than the content’
        (Teacher, School 3). It seems that these teachers have yet to make the
        
        
        358
        
        J. Byrne et al.
        
        intellectual adjustment to their established role and practice that these
        competence-based lessons require.
        
        Issue 2: the predominance of content and subject knowledge in lessons
        Despite the aims of lessons being articulated in terms of skills and
        competencies, the majority of lessons we observed had an emphasis on
        subject content, many with a focus on history or other aspects of the
        humanities subjects. This reﬂects the nature of the programme in two of
        the case study schools but the interdisciplinary aspect of lessons in School
        3 was only explicitly evident in one of the lessons in which students were
        asked to work as a team for The Wild Life Trust to improve a small
        nature reserve. This lesson involved students in many skills including
        decision-making, working to a budget, planning, discussion, team work
        and cooperation but this was a rare occurrence. In School 1 the topics are
        planned in a more interdisciplinary manner than the other schools, with
        fewer lessons directly focussed on an individual subject, and some
        teachers exhorted the students to think about the skills they were
        employing. In a lesson where the students were cooking pizza the students
        were reminded to think about time management and working as a team,
        as
        ‘Which
        teacher was observed during the lesson saying:
        competencies are vital here? Did you look at the clock? How well did
        you manage your time/work with your partner?’ (Teacher, School 1).
        
        this
        
        But, as mentioned earlier, no explicit instructions about how the
        students could manage their time or work as a team eﬀectively were given,
        and teachers were still concerned to know what the students had learned
        in terms of subject content, which feeds into the students’ perceptions of
        their programme as more subject-based than competence-based:
        
        The diﬀerent modules like relate to diﬀerent subjects, like one is a kind of
        the Science type, and another is the English and Drama, kind of, because if
        you’re presenting it, you know . . . it’s English. Oh yeah, because you do the
        role play. (Student, School 1)
        
        It seems that even in the more competence-based practice observed in
        School 1 the tension between delivery of content and enabling skill
        development in lessons is an issue. The strong vertical discourse of
        academic disciplines is entrenched in most secondary schools and this
        creates tensions for the teachers who are involved, for part of their time,
        in the more diverse and segmented aspects of competence-based lessons
        where subject content is abandoned in favour of skill development. These
        diverse roles are hard to juggle and it is not surprising that teachers have
        diﬃculty in managing skill- and competence-based lessons eﬀectively,
        especially as they move from one context to another, as this teacher
        points out: ‘Yeah. I do, as a new teacher, constantly have to be keeping
        
        
        The Curriculum Journal 359
        
        the competencies up here [points to head] . . . sometimes forget that that’s
        my aim, it’s actually to teach the competencies rather than to teach
        the . . . [subject content]’ (Teacher, School 1).
        
        These problems are clearly related to their perceptions of
        the
        traditional role of a teacher as a deliverer of content knowledge and a
        subject expert. Their identities are bound up with the subject they teach
        and this is constantly endorsed by discussions with colleagues in subject
        departments. The weak classiﬁcation of competence-based lessons where
        everyday knowledge supersedes
        subject content knowledge creates
        tensions for these teachers that they ﬁnd problematic, as they struggle
        to overcome their subject-based identity:
        
        I ﬁnd it really diﬃcult to focus on [just skills] being a Historian I focus on
        like knowledge, and I found it really hard . . . I found it really hard to focus
        on the skill rather than what we’re actually doing. Do you know what I
        mean? So the Egypt thing, I like the Egyptian knowledge and under-
        standing, that’s what I like and I forget that I’m supposed to be doing like
        teamwork or individual learning or research, and I forget to focus on the
        skill. That I found quite hard. (Teacher, School 3)
        
        Therefore, teacher subject bias and subject specialism appears to inﬂuence
        what happens in the classroom and subject content knowledge rather than
        skill development predominates in lessons. Furthermore, because teachers
        are more secure in their identity as subject specialists their conﬁdence can be
        undermined when they are required to teach competence-based, multi-
        disciplinary lessons as non-experts. These lessons can lead teachers to ques-
        tion their subject-based identity and this may, inadvertently, lead to a greater
        emphasis on certain subjects than others, creating a tension between the
        overall aims of the programme and what actually happens in the classroom.
        
        Issue 3: non-expert teaching and teacher self-eﬃcacy and conﬁdence
        As teachers wrestle with the unfamiliarity of competence-based multi-
        disciplinary lessons they may experience a lack of agency that may lead
        them to doubt their abilities and this can undermine their conﬁdence and
        aﬀect what and how they teach. Losing one’s traditional subject-based
        identity seems to have made some teachers feel less eﬀective and conﬁdent
        in the classroom as a result of having to assume the role of a non-
        specialist. They have reverted to practices that endorse their self-eﬃcacy;
        for example, focusing on the content of a single subject or providing
        highly structured lessons that prevent students from eﬀectively engaging
        with skills in a multidisciplinary context, and this has the potential to
        subvert the aims of the programme:
        
        when I’m teaching like History I wouldn’t open myself up to kind of them
        questioning me on it because I’d be too scared that I’d give them the wrong
        answer, whereas with an RE thing I’d give them – or even Geography I’m
        
        
        360
        
        J. Byrne et al.
        
        more conﬁdent with because I’ve taught that as well – but I would give
        them kind of more open stuﬀ that they can then give back to me and we can
        have a discussion on. But with the History thing I’d be more inclined to give
        them stuﬀ that they then can’t question me too deeply so I don’t look too
        stupid. (Teacher, School 4)
        
        I think you kind of tend to have lots of small short activities that are not
        going to challenge them, or challenge you, so that then you’re not going to
        get yourself caught in a situation where you can’t answer a question. I tend
        to have lots of kind of basic ‘here’s the information. Here’s the activity to
        do with it’. (Teacher, School 4)
        
        What is surprising is that the lack of conﬁdence was most evident in
        School 4, where the programme is based on a small number of humanities
        subjects and all the teachers are humanities specialists. This lack of
        conﬁdence may be because of closely related specialisms; for example, the
        lack of conﬁdence of biologists to teach physics, and these teachers may
        feel keenly how little they know about a related specialism, such as RE. It
        is also worth noting that School 4 has the least well developed programme
        of all the case study schools, and unfamiliarity with the materials may
        also exacerbate these teachers’ feelings. However, this does not appear to
        be the case in other schools where teachers are more experienced because
        they have been involved with a programme for longer. They appear to
        have risen to the challenge with positive outcomes:
        
        . . . So it’s the ﬁrst time I’ve done anything with that . . . English. . . and it
        was never my strong subject either at school. It was completely out of my
        comfort zone. I was very anxious about it, I suppose, to begin with, but
        now I love it. (Teacher, School 1)
        
        This requires a change in the classiﬁcation of lessons from subject knowl-
        edge to a greater focus on skill development, as this teacher says: ‘I’m not
        a Maths teacher, I can’t do that . . . I’m giving them the skills to ﬁnd out, to
        know where to go, to then develop that . . . ’ (Teacher, School 1).
        
        Issue 4: teacher role and student autonomy
        The predominance of more conventional modes of teaching and learning,
        individual work coupled with whole-class instruction, that we observed in
        surprising given the explicit emphasis on
        some programmes was
        encouraging pupils to become independent learners. Generally, teachers
        combined the role of facilitator with the more traditional roles of
        instructor and demonstrator in the lessons we observed. However, a
        higher proportion of time was spent on whole-class work than might have
        been expected and these periods of each lesson tended to be teacher-
        dominated even when this was a question-and-answer session, with the
        teacher acting as an instructor, information-giver and questioner.
        
        
        The Curriculum Journal
        
        361
        
        The challenge in obtaining a balance between teacher-led or more
        student-led lessons that these programmes raise does not seem to be easily
        resolved, as observations of lessons indicated. The majority of lessons
        tended to be teacher-directed and teacher-led. The students were generally
        quite passive during whole-class aspects of lessons; either listening to the
        teacher’s instruction, or answering teacher-generated questions. Little
        student inﬂuence on the direction and content of the learning was
        observed, other than in low-level decisions about structural and pro-
        cedural issues, such as who they might work with and which teacher-
        directed task they would do, indicating a lower order of thinking and less
        demanding engagement. Students were given some limited opportunities
        for decision-making and autonomy, for example whether to do a poster
        or a presentation. Thinking skills and student independence are high-
        lighted as part of these programmes’ aims and yet, student autonomy or
        student-led learning was rarely observed; this ﬁnding seems to contradict
        the liberal and liberating aspects of the competence-based curricula
        adopted in these schools: ‘Sometimes our group we have like presenta-
        tions and we can choose whether we want to do a poster or a story or a
        drama’ (Student, School 4).
        
        However, these opportunities for autonomy are within the parameters of
        the tasks set by the teacher, and students were heavily reliant on the teacher
        for the timing and pace, and the nature of activities and resources used in
        lessons. This may lead to a situation in which students are unable to succeed
        in achieving the independence and resourcefulness that these programmes
        aim to provide. The need to stay in control of their classes creates tensions
        for teachers as they move between the more familiar practice of strongly
        framed lessons and the expectations and aims of weakly framed competence-
        based approaches to teaching and learning. The tension is partly because of
        concerns about teacher identity as the didactic expert in lessons which are
        designed to give students more autonomy and responsibility for their
        learning, as this teacher indicates:
        
        I don’t like to feel as though I’m not in total control of the lessons. I don’t
        do lots and lots of group work because I like to have a real ﬁrm grip on the
        lessons, so I do ﬁnd myself teaching it sort of relatively similarly to
        humanities. I probably should let them go oﬀ and do a bit more themselves
        and really sort of open it up and put them in to the pit, but I don’t, I just
        like to keep control. (Teacher, School 2)
        
        The lack of student autonomy may also stem from teachers’ concerns
        about poor or oﬀ-task behaviour, but this again provides a tension
        between the reality of how the classroom operates and the declared
        intention of the programmes. Managing the balance between student- and
        teacher-led aspects of lessons is clearly a challenge and again highlights
        the tension for teachers between traditional and more progressive
        
        
        362
        
        J. Byrne et al.
        
        classroom approaches. Managing behaviour, maintaining the role of
        didactic expert and yet enabling students to work actively to provide them
        with some freedom and autonomy is a tension that teachers have
        acknowledged and they recognise that a diﬀerent pedagogical approach is
        required to enable students to succeed within these lessons, but it isn’t
        necessarily easy to achieve, as this teacher suggests:
        
        I think that’s what the Year 7 programme has taught me . . . you can be
        much more ﬂexible and I have changed so my class can look quite manic
        because where you give some of them one task with someone else doing a
        completely diﬀerent task to the rest of the class . . . but it works . . . and the
        kids have more choice in what they do . . . and therefore they own the task
        more. (Teacher, School 1)
        
        The need for teachers metaphorically to ‘hand over the pen’ is essential if
        these programmes are to succeed to their maximum potential.
        ‘Less
        teacher’ is the mantra for one curriculum leader and some teachers have
        been able to make this transition successfully: ‘Yeah, it took me a long
        time to do that [allow greater student autonomy] though, because you
        have to change the way you teach’ (Teacher, School 2).
        
        Summary of ﬁndings
        In summary the ﬁndings of the present study indicate that one issue for
        teachers engaging in competence-based lessons is their concerns about
        developing their practice to focus on teaching skill-development rather than
        subject content. This can lead to tensions about their identity as subject
        specialist teachers as they question their role in the classroom. As a result
        there is a tendency for teachers to revert to the strong vertical discourse of
        academic disciplines which leads to a greater emphasis on subject content
        creating a tension between the overall aims of the programme and what
        actually happens in the classroom. Furthermore, because teachers are more
        secure in their identity as subject specialists, tensions arise as their conﬁdence
        is undermined when they are required to teach competence-based, multi-
        disciplinary lessons as non-experts. As a consequence the structure of some
        lessons is heavily proscribed and this can also undermine the aims of the
        programmes. Finally a CBC requires teachers to alter their modus operandi
        as the didactic expert who leads and directs the learning, and this creates
        additional tensions between the traditional role of the teachers and the aim
        to give students more autonomy over their learning.
        
        Discussion and conclusion
        All four programmes have aims and intentions that are synergistic with a
        democratic, child-centred, progressive curriculum that aims to develop
        
        
        The Curriculum Journal
        
        363
        
        pupils as learners for life rather than treating them as repositories of
        knowledge (Dewey 1916; Kelly 2009). However, tensions between the
        articulated aims of the four programmes and the day-to-day reality of life
        in classrooms are apparent and these diﬃculties are founded in what
        teachers perceive as diametrically opposed roles; that of a traditional
        teacher and the requirements of a more ﬂexible and progressive approach
        to teaching and learning.
        
        Major issues appear to emanate from tensions teachers experience
        between the powerful vertical discourse of traditional subject teaching
        and learning and the horizontal discourse of multi-disciplinary compe-
        tence-based approaches. Teachers regard their academic subjects as
        sacred or powerful knowledge and have diﬃculties in forgoing subject
        content in favour of a focus on skills or a multi-disciplinary approach,
        even in closely related humanities subjects. The strong classiﬁcation
        evident in these secondary schools is diﬃcult for teachers to relinquish but
        this is not surprising given that they perceive their role as subject and
        didactic specialists (Beijaard, Verloop, and Vermunt 2000). The narra-
        tives teachers engaged in personally or with colleagues appeared to
        employ the vertical rather than horizontal discourse more frequently
        (Trent 2010; Varghese et al. 2005) and thus their traditional identities are
        created and endorsed (Davies and Harre 1999; Sfard and Prusak 2005).
        These teachers’ identities are in part, therefore, framed by the subjects
        they teach (Busher and Harris 1999; Woolhouse and Cochrane 2010).
        When this is threatened, as in a competence-based lesson, they appear to
        be less able or willing to embrace innovative practice and revert to more
        familiar teaching and learning approaches that focus on subject-speciﬁc
        content (Whitty et al. 1994) and thus undermine the aims of these pro-
        grammes (Beijaard et al. 2004).
        
        Furthermore some teachers in this study felt anxious about how to
        operate in the classroom and questioned their role in these competence-
        based multi-disciplinary lessons. Beauchamp and Thomas (2009) note
        that the discrepancy between the ‘ought’ and ‘real’ self can result in
        teachers experiencing a loss of identity that reduces self-conﬁdence and
        self-eﬃcacy. The lack of agency felt by some teachers was apparent and
        they did feel uncomfortable at times with the expectations of the new
        programmes in much the same way as ‘non-specialists’ do when they are
        required to teach beyond their subject expertise (Kind 2009; Seddon and
        Biasutti 2008). These feelings of inadequacy led teachers to favour lessons
        that were highly controlled and focussed on single-subject content over a
        multi-disciplinary approach in a bid to maintain and protect their identity
        (Ketelaar et al. 2012), but in doing so the aims of the programmes are
        threatened.
        
        Lack of conﬁdence was not the only reason lessons were highly
        teacher-controlled and led. Teachers regard themselves as didactic experts
        
        
        364
        
        J. Byrne et al.
        
        and the weak framing of competence-based lessons required teachers to
        adopt the role of coach or facilitator of learning to enable students to have
        more autonomy over their learning (Beijaard, Verloop, and Vermunt
        2000). The unfamiliarity of this role also threatened their identity and
        created tensions for teachers as they struggled with their established self-
        perceptions of themselves as the teacher (Ketelaar et al. 2012).
        
        Therefore, diﬃculties arise for teachers who have an established
        traditional modus operandi and identity in looking the other way in order
        to manage the juggling act required to achieve Bernstein’s notion of the
        ‘pedagogic schizoid’. However, some teachers have, at least in part,
        achieved this balancing act, especially in schools where a CBC is more
        established. Furthermore, these teachers appeared to be quite comfor-
        table in this new role to the extent that it had aﬀected their practice in
        other areas of their teaching.
        
        However, it also necessitated a change in the power relationships
        within the classroom (Foucault 1979). The move from strong framing
        to weak framing (Bernstein 1973) requires teachers to be prepared to
        share decision-making with their students about what and how they
        learn (Freire 1972). Letting go of this level of authority and control is
        clearly diﬃcult and as a result students’ autonomy is compromised to
        some extent in all four case study schools. Teachers legitimised their
        maintenance of control for sound reasons such as managing poor or
        oﬀ-task behaviour. However, the extent to which students had the
        freedom to make their own decisions and to exercise autonomy over
        their learning by metaphorically ‘taking hold of the pen’ varied in each
        school. This is dependent to a large extent on the context in which the
        programme takes place. It may be harder to allow students in some
        schools to have freedom and ownership of their own learning than in
        others where, for example, behaviour issues are less of a problem. That
        said, disenfranchising these students, some of whom may be from more
        disadvantaged backgrounds than others, means that the power rela-
        tionship in society is constantly reproduced in school (Foucault 1979)
        and these competence-based programmes that aim to provide a more
        egalitarian and inclusive approach to education will be jeopardised
        (Yates and Collins 2010), with the potential eﬀect of denying these
        pupils access to the educational discourse and the danger of main-
        taining the social educational divide (Bernstein 1973). Successfully
        managing the inherent tensions between traditional and progressive
        pedagogies will facilitate students’ full integration and successful parti-
        cipation as members of twenty-ﬁrst-century society rather than repro-
        ducing the socio-economic status quo, or the requirements of the
        current dominant educational discourse. Education in this sense is not
        merely reproduction of
        is
        square pegs
        empowering and enabling (Freire 1972).

        Perhaps teachers new to these innovative curricular programmes can
        learn from established colleagues in order to develop a more democratic
        approach to their teaching (Dewey 1916) that will support the aims of the
        programmes and enable pupils to develop skills for life. In-service
        training and opportunities for professional development such as observa-
        tion of others would help to induct and support staﬀ, although they need
        to be followed through with sustained support if they are to have a lasting
        impact (Dabrowski and Wis´ niewski 2011). Alongside speciﬁc training in
        how to develop students’ skills and improve subject knowledge, for
        example, providing more detailed resources, these measures may help to
        ensure that all lessons have a wider subject as well as skills-based focus.
        For those who believe that education should be socially transformative
        and personally fulﬁlling, continuing with and developing this outward-
        looking and progressive approach to teaching and learning is an
        important aspect of these schools’ curricula. This is especially pertinent
        in England in light of the potential changes to current UK government
        education policy, which emphasise more traditional teaching that focuses
        on the teaching of subject disciplines (Department for Education 2010).
        However, with this step towards a more traditional approach to the
        curriculum, the emphasis on discrete subjects and more traditional
        teaching methods, the schools described here may be required to reassess
        their CBCs and return to a more traditional curriculum. Teachers who
        have successfully adapted to new pedagogical approaches will, therefore,
        ﬁnd themselves struggling with yet another change and perhaps feel even
        more schizophrenic. It may be necessary for the case study schools to re-
        frame their programmes to enable teachers to manage more easily the
        impending changes to the curriculum, as well as their own identities, by
        adopting Young’s (2008, 2011) notion of a social realist epistemology in
        which powerful and everyday knowledge structures are accepted as
        diﬀerent yet complementary. Whatever occurs in these case-study schools
        in the future, it is clear that the tension between these two diametrically
        opposed philosophical and ideological positions is likely to be most
        keenly felt in the classroom.
